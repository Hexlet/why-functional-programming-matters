This paper owes much to many conversations with Phil Wadler and Richard
Bird in the Programming Research Group at Oxford. Magnus Bondesson at
Chalmers University, GÂ¨
oteborg, pointed out a serious error in an earlier version
of one of the numerical algorithms, and thereby prompted development of many
of the others. Ham Richards and David Turner did a superb editorial job,
including converting the notation to Miranda. This work was carried out with
the support of a Research Fellowship from the U.K. Science and Engineering
Research Council.
